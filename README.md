# Search History Explorer

This is a toy project to play with Apache Spark.

It allows you explore your search history that Google lets you export [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6068625?hl=en).

To run the example as it is you need to append the path of your unzipped `Searches` export folder as a CL parameter.
All .json files in that folder will then be picked and can be processed with Spark.
